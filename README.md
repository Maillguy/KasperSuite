# KasperSuite
This is my Capstone Project for my COMP 490 class, but this is also an ongoing project for me. After graduating, I will continue to work on KasperSuite as a piece of professional software that may or may not get published. This project is a labor of love for me, i love working on code, and i love workeing on new things even more.
